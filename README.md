# My Data Science Projects from Datacamp Datasets
Sharing the projects I created and done from the datacamp Data Scientist with Python career path. This repo also aims to group all my data science and analytics projects.


## Python
### Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

Project Description
Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, you will work with a dataset containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

You will identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!

### Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats
Analyze an A/B test from the popular mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats.

Project Description
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding!

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.

To complete this project, you should be comfortable working with pandas DataFrames and with using the pandas plot method. You should also have some understanding of hypothesis testing and bootstrap analysis.
